ease and comfort to patients to book inclinc and video appointment with doctors and it
also resolves the problems that the patients has to face while booking an appointment and
this application also provides online video consultation feature so the doctors can easily
consult their patient and give prescription to the patient. Patient who are afraid to go in
hospital they can easily book video appointment with doctor and because of video meeting
